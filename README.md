# landing-page

## Description

Hypothetical landing page for a collaborative dentistry practice for me and my class partner Daniel. This page offers a navigation with links to our contact form, which allows potential patients to send us their info so that we may contact them for a visit.

The site uses semantic html and image captioning to improve readability for screen readers. Use of color creates contrast between sections making it easier to navigate the site by more clearly demarcating content sections, in addition to being more aesthetically pleasing. The header and nav bar stay make use of fixed positioning and z-index in order to allow access to our practice name and navigation links throughout the page. 

This project uses HTML and CSS, as well as GitBash and Github to store changes and create the deployment link.

## Credits

Any applicable credits to w3 for input forms, to my class partner Daniel Stefani, and to my girlfriend for helping me fix the placement of the body section to not be covered by the header.
